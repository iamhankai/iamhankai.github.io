I am currently a principal research scientist at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://noahlab.com.hk/#/home), working closely with [Yunhe Wang](https://www.wangyunhe.site/). I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhejiang University and Peking University (advised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1084/1272.htm)) respectively, and
the Ph.D degree from Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (advised by [Prof. Enhua Wu](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/ehwu/)). My research interests lie in foundation models, deep learning and computer vision.
